Activity 1:

Step 1:

letterboxd movie app recommender
    import letterboxd username and recommend movies based off of ratings of movies person has already watched

lastfm analytics and music recommender
    import lastfm (music tracking website) username and give statistics based on their listening habits, most popular artist, most listened genre, etc.

rate and review your favorite albums
    allows a user to rate albums from their phone. can also implement lastfm to pull up recently listened albums

Step 2:

I want to combine the lastfm analytics and the rate albums app
 
Mobile: The app can give notifications for recnently listened albums asking you to rate it. 
Most people listen to music on their phone making it more convenient than a website

Story: A convenient and easy place to quickly rate albums and share a virtual collection of music

Market: Millions of people listen to music everyday and everyone has opinions on it. This is a place to share those opinions.

Habit: The user would open this app whenever they want to rate an album or learn about their music habits

Scope: It will be quite technically challenging to create all the capabilities of this app
A stripped down version would be interesting
I'd say the product is clearly defined for me.

Final Idea:

A music analytics and reviewing app that gives you statistics based on your listening habits, recommends you new albums, and allows you to rate the music you have listened to.
