## Overview

### Description

A music analytics and reviewing app that gives you statistics based on your listening habits, recommends you new albums, and allows you to rate the music you have listened to.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
Mobile: The app can give notifications for recently listened albums asking you to rate it. 
Most people listen to music on their phone making it more convenient than a website

Story: A convenient and easy place to quickly rate albums and share a virtual collection of music

Market: Millions of people listen to music everyday and everyone has opinions on it. This is a place to share those opinions.

Habit: The user would open this app whenever they want to rate an album or learn about their music habits

Scope: It will be quite technically challenging to create all the capabilities of this app
A stripped down version would be interesting
I'd say the product is clearly defined for me.
